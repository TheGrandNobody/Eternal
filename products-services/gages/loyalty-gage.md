# Loyalty Gage

### Definition

Loyalty gages involve an entity or individual distributing an asset (**the distributor**), to another entity or individual receiving said asset (**the receiver**). The risked percentage of the distributor is rewarded to the receiver twice: once instantly, and another time upon closing of the gage in favor of the receiver. The risked percentage of the distributor is always lower than that of the receiver.

### Properties

**Distributor Condition:**  Depends on context and industry

{% hint style="info" %}
In traditional finance, the condition is generally set to re-issuance of shares. In decentralized finance, the condition is set to the non-withdrawal of the deposit.
{% endhint %}

**Receiver Condition:** Non-withdrawal of deposit

**Symbiosis. **Loyalty gages create symbiotic relationships between any given distributor and receiver.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Example – Traditional Finance**</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">Alice owns a company that needs healthy investors who will hold their shares in the long-term. Bob is an investor wanting to make money under as little time as possible and wants to purchase 100 of Alice's shares. Alice, in this case the distributor, offers a loyalty gage to Bob, the receiver. The loyalty gage offers Bob 100 shares (the deposit), with a 10% risk percentage for Alice and an 11% risk percentage for Bob. The distributor condition depends on whether Alice re-issues common stock. The receiver condition depends on whether Bob withdraws the 100-share deposit.  As soon as the loyalty gage is active, 10 shares are instantly rewarded to Bob. If Bob withdraws the 100 shares deposited in the contract before Alice's company re-issues shares, then Bob loses 11 shares. If Alice re-issues shares before Bob withdraws his deposit, then Alice pays Bob an additional 10 shares.</mark>
