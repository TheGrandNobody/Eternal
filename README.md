# ðŸ“” Introduction/FAQ

## What is Eternal?

First and foremost, Eternal is **not a company** and **not owned by anyone except for its token holders.** As a result, the company Eternal Finance B.V and the architect Nobody, hold no initial stake in Eternal.&#x20;

Second, Eternal **aims to popularize a new class of long-term DeFi tools, gages, as a solution to a $1.7 trillion problem named short-termism.**

## What is short-termism?

Short-termism is **the habit of focusing on short-term results at the cost of long-term gain**. Think of someone who tries to earn money as fast as possible, without thinking about risk, or someone who only eats takeaway, without thinking about their health. Sounds familiar? We've all been there. Point is, whether its a money-hungry firm who doesn't care about the world, or investors aping on risky meme tokens, we're psychologically engineered to be short-termist.&#x20;

**And it's costing the world $79.1 billion every year, for the past 22 years.**

## What is a gage?

A gage is broadly defined as a **contract between two or more stakeholders who promise to pay a given percentage of a deposited asset to the last stakeholder who breaks a predetermined condition.** It's a lot easier to understand a gage through its applications: you can do exactly that by reading [the gage section](products-services/gages/), or our academic whitepaper introducing gages.

## Why should I use gages?

The developed gage-related applications, are not only designed and proven to **earn you more money** with **less risk than any other instrument**, they're also **completely free** and **accessible to all**. The catch? You will need to fight your short-termist instincts, and approach everything with a long-term mentality. This simply means that the most patient investors will win the most money.&#x20;

**Are you more patient than everyone else?**

## How do gages solve short-termism?

**Gages are particularly useful when it comes to creating win-win relationships between two or more individuals.** Short-termism arises as a result of poor dynamics between individuals. For example, one of the main reasons firms are short-termist is because of the unhealthy relationship they with their investors, who, you've guessed it, are also short-termist.

**Use Case â€“ The Firm-Investor Dilemma:**

Firms rely on investors to buy and hold their shares. Investors want to make money as fast as possible, and will consequently tend to choose firms which make the most short-term profits. This forces firms to make poor short-term choices in order to survive. As a result, this causes long-term issues, like unemployment, pollution, less R\&D and ironically, less revenue and growth for the firm.

In this case we propose a solution with [loyalty gages](products-services/gages/loyalty-gage.md).

**Most gages are a solution to one of the many aspects of short-termism.**

## What is the company Eternal Finance B.V for then?

Eternal Finance B.V is necessary for **two reasons:**

**Initial Deployment**

Eternal is a self-sustaining structure. Think of this as a constantly spinning water wheel powered by a river's stream. In this case, Eternal is the water-wheel, and its users (you), the river. Thus, for this to work, we need a water-wheel and an initial stream of sufficient size.

Eternal Finance B.V was necessary to obtain the funds which covered not only marketing (initial stream), but also the designers, front-end developer, audits, website, hosting and any other ingredients (water wheel) required for these two basic necessities.

**Future Releases**

Unfortunately, we have not reached a point in society where all systems are fully decentralized. Eternal Finance B.V is primarily here to serve as a bridge of trust between the centralized and decentralized. This will be useful for upcoming releases, where some applications are particularly useful to countries where internet access is not as common, or to make necessary agreements with governments.

## What's the governance in status Eternal?

In the **second quarter post-launch**, the Eternal Fund will be released and Eternal will go from having Nobody as the initial admin, to a fully decentralized autonomous organization and no admin. This decision was chosen for **two reasons:**

**1. Community Input**

The best systems have the input of the users, not just the architect. This means that the Eternal Fund needs to be designed with the community's opinion taken into account.

**2. Treasury**

The Eternal Fund holds a treasury funded by the Eternal token. Don't worry, no one can access it, not even Nobody. It's best to give it some time to let the Fund accumulate some value.
