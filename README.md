# ðŸ“” Introduction/FAQ

## What is Eternal?

First and foremost, Eternal **is not a company and not owned by anyone except for its token holders. **

Second, Eternal aims to **popularize a new class of long-term DeFi tools, gages, as a solution to a $1.7 trillion problem named short-termism**.

## What is short-termism?

Short-termism is **the habit of focusing on short-term results at the cost of long-term gain**. Think of someone who tries to earn money as fast as possible, without thinking about risk, or someone who only eats takeaway, without thinking about their health. Sounds familiar? We've all been there. Point is, whether its a firm polluting to gain more money, or investors aping on risky meme tokens, we're psychologically engineered to be short-termist.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**And it's costing the world $79.1 billion every year, for the past 22 years.**</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">**But what if instead of wasting this money, there was a way for us to save it? **</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">**Maybe, even put it in our pockets?**</mark>

## What is a gage?

A gage is broadly defined as a** contract between two or more stakeholders who promise to pay a given percentage of a deposited asset to the last stakeholder who breaks a predetermined condition.** It's a lot easier to understand a gage through its applications: you can do exactly that by reading [the gage section](products-services/gages/).

## Why should I use gages?

The developed gage-related applications, are not only designed and proven to earn you <mark style="color:purple;">**more money**</mark>** **with** **<mark style="color:purple;">**less risk**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">**than any other instrument**</mark>, they're also <mark style="color:purple;">**completely free**</mark> and <mark style="color:purple;">**accessible to all**</mark>. The catch? You will need to fight your short-termist instincts, and approach everything with a long-term mentality. This simply means that the most patient investors will win the most money.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Are you more patient than everyone else?**</mark>
