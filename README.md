# ðŸ“” Introduction/FAQ

## What is Eternal?

Eternal is the world's first decentralized gaging platform, **aiming to popularize a new class of long-term financial instruments, gages, as a solution to a $1.7 trillion problem named short-termism.**

However Eternal is **not a company** and **not owned by anyone except for its token holders.** Even the company Eternal Finance B.V and the architect Nobody, hold no initial stake in Eternal.

## What is short-termism?

Short-termism is **the habit of focusing on short-term results at the cost of long-term gain**. For instance, take an individual trying to earn money as fast as possible, paying no attention to risk, or another who only eats takeaway, ignoring their health.&#x20;

**Sounds familiar? We've all been there.**&#x20;

Whether it is the money-hungry corporations with no care for the world, investors aping on risky meme tokens, or mercenary liquidity providers, [we are all psychologically engineered to be short-termist](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.89.1.103).

Most of the time, **the majority of us are making decisions which only benefit us in the moment and end up hurting us or others later on.**

## **Why should I care about short-termism?**

Short termism is everywhere. We breathe short-termism, we make and use short-termist technology and we think and act short-term. Here are **two of the most relevant centralized and decentralized examples of short-termism:**

**The **<mark style="color:red;">**Firm-Investor**</mark>** Dilemma:**

Firms rely on investors to buy and hold their shares. Investors want to make money as fast as possible, and will consequently tend to choose firms which make the most short-term profits. In turn, firms do everything in their power to increase short-term revenue and end up making all kinds of poor decisions with no regard for their long-term consequences. This leads to more issues like unemployment, pollution, less R\&D and ironically, less revenue and growth for the firm.

**And it's costing firms $79.1 billion every year for the past 22 years.**
{% endhint %}

**The **<mark style="color:red;">**Liquidity-Provider**</mark>** Dilemma:**

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) and Blockchain projects rely on liquidity providers in order for tokens to be traded at any given price level on DEXs. Liquidity providers want to earn as much money as possible, and therefore will only provide liquidity in the very short-term (<15 days), whilst the pool rewards are still relatively high, before moving to another project. In turn, projects attempt to appeal to liquidity providers by offering high yields, making all kinds of poor decisions with no regard for their long-term consequences. This leads to more issues such as abnormally high inflation rates, inadequate reflection of value by the token, longer downtrends and periods of recovery and radical short-termist culture.

**There is a short-termist issue in almost every single industry and it is reflecting in the global issues we are currently witnessing with our economies, health systems, environment...**

You name it.

## What is a gage?

A gage is broadly defined as a **contract between two or more stakeholders who promise to pay a given percentage of a deposited asset to the last stakeholder who breaks a predetermined condition.** It is a lot easier to understand a gage through its applications: you may do so by reading [the gage section](products-services/gages/), or the academic whitepaper, _Introduction to gages_.

## Why should I use gages?

The developed gage-related applications, are not only designed and proven to **earn you more money with less risk than any other instrument**, they are also **completely free**, **accessible to all** and **can significantly help change our short-termist behaviour**. The catch? You will need to fight your short-termist instincts, and approach everything with a long-term mentality. This simply means that **the most patient investors will win the most money**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Are you more patient than everyone else?**
{% endhint %}

## How do gages solve short-termism?

**Short-termism arises as a result of poor dynamics between individuals.** For example, back to our firm-investor dilemma, one of the main reasons firms are short-termist is because of their unhealthy relationships with investors, who are also short-termist. **Gages are particularly useful when it comes to creating win-win relationships between two or more individuals.**

For this specific dilemma we propose a solution with [loyalty gages](products-services/gages/loyalty-gage.md).

But that is not the end of it.

**Most gages are a solution to a specific aspect of short-termism; there are already four other solutions to four additional aspects that are just as harmful, only waiting to be announced.**

## What is the company Eternal Finance B.V for then?

Eternal Finance B.V is necessary for **two reasons:**

**1. Initial Deployment**

Eternal is a self-sustaining structure. Think of this as a constantly spinning water wheel powered by a river's stream. In this case, Eternal is the water-wheel, and its users (you), the river. Thus, for this to work, we need a water-wheel and an initial stream of sufficient size.

Eternal Finance B.V was necessary to obtain the funds which covered not only marketing (initial stream), but also the designers, front-end developer, audits, website, hosting and any other ingredients (water wheel) required for these two basic necessities.

**2. Future Releases**

Unfortunately, we have not reached a point in society where all systems are fully decentralized. Eternal Finance B.V is primarily here to serve as a bridge of trust between the centralized and decentralized. This will be useful for upcoming releases, where some applications are particularly useful to countries where internet access is not as common, or to make necessary agreements with governments.

## What is the governance like in Eternal?

In the **second quarter post-launch**, the Eternal Fund will be released and Eternal will go from having Nobody as the initial admin, to nobody as the admin. Meaning, Eternal will become a fully decentralized autonomous organization. This decision was made for **two reasons:**

**1. Community Input**

The best systems have the input of the users, not just the architect. This means that the Eternal Fund needs to be designed with the community's opinion taken into account.

**2. Treasury**

The Eternal Fund holds a treasury funded by the Eternal token. However, it needs a minimum time period for it to accumulate some value. Do not worry, no one can access it, not even Nobody.

## Who is Nobody?

nobody.
