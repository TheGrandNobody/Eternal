# ðŸª™ ETRNL

<mark style="color:purple;">ETRNL (spelled out "Eternal") is fundamentally, one of the three main cogs in the entire long-termist synergetic system which makes up the whole of Eternal.  Functionally, it is Eternal's governance and utility token, as well as the primary currency of usage on the platform.</mark>&#x20;

## <mark style="color:purple;">Economic Value</mark>

The intrinsic value of ETRNL is generated and guaranteed by six factors:

### <mark style="color:blue;">1. Gaging Fees</mark>

For all gages, regardless of centralized or decentralized applications, a small fee is taken on any deposited assets which are not ETRNL. This fee occurs upon withdrawal of the asset from the given gage and is instantly transferred to the Eternal Fund. This ensures that **ETRNL is backed by a basket of goods, which accrues in diversity and quantity over time.**&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">2. Automatic Liquidity Provision</mark>

On every transaction with ETRNL, a small fee is computed. **ETRNL provides its own liquidity to decentralized exchanges** using a fraction of this fee. As the **LP-tokens received from this are locked away forever and unaccessible by anyone, this entails the autonomous creation and maintenance of a price floor for ETRNL.**

### <mark style="color:blue;">3/4. Reward Redistribution & Funding (Indefinite Deflation)</mark>

One other fraction of the aforementioned ETRNL fee is sent to the Eternal Fund  and another is redistributed to all holders of ETRNL. As the Eternal Fund accumulates ETRNL in its treasury, it slowly begins compounding its ETRNL reserves over time. **The total ETRNL supply temporarily deflates as part of it remains unused in the Eternal Fund for an indefinite period of time. This percentage of the supply can be re-injected into the economy in the event that ETRNL's rate of deflation becomes detrimentally high.**&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">5/6. Supply burn and Limited Supply (Definite Deflation)</mark>

At present, most major currencies in our world's economy are inflationary. This is also true to cryptocurrencies. With such contexts in mind, deflation leads to the increase of purchasing power of a given token. This further reinforced by the idea that the other currencies against which ETRNL is compared to are inflationary, hence their purchasing power decreases. **ETRNL is deflationary by standard due to having a limited supply**, where no new ETRNL will be printed. Additionally, **ETRNL also burns its supply, which introduces a rate of deflation. This rate is modifiable and can therefore be deactivated in any event of economical distress.**&#x20;
