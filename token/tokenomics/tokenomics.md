# Tokenomics

### Distribution&#x20;

Following Eternal's pledge of being created by the people, for the people, a fair launched [Initial Gage Offering](../../products-services/gages/initial-gage-offering.md) will be put in place. Furthermore, in the name of total decentralization of governance, neither the Eternal team or the Eternal B.V owns any initial stake in the system. Instead, both will participate in periodic buy-backs and earn their stake this way.

### Token Allocation

**Maximum/Total Initial Circulating Supply:** 10 billion

* Minimum of 42.5% reserved for a fair launched Initial Gage Offering (IGO)
* Minimum of 42.5% locked into the Eternal Fund
* 10% reserved for the seed sale
* 5% reserved for the private sale

{% hint style="info" %}
**Leftover tokens from the IGO and seed and private sales are sent to the Eternal Fund.**
{% endhint %}

### Seed/Private Investor Vesting Schedules

All seed and private investors who purchased ETRNL, vested their tokens on the basis of the decrease in supply of ETRNL, following the equation:

$$
available\space tokens =vested\space{tokens}\times \frac{initial\space supply - current\space  supply}{initial\space supply}\gamma
$$

**Where** $$\gamma$$ **is equal to 4 for seed investors and 10 for private investors**, ensuring that these individuals  will only have full access to their funds once the total supply has decreased by 25% and 10%, respectively.

Taking the initial rate of deflation to be 0.5% per transaction, and assuming a minimum constant monthly transaction volume of 50 million ETRNL, this entails a **minimum vesting period of over 48 and 20 months**, respectively. In reality, the monthly transaction volume will likely be a lot lower than this optimistic guess. Hence, this also aligns with the idea that our investors believe in ETRNL in the long-term.
